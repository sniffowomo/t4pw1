# What ?

1. This was originally downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/TechForPalestine/boycott-israeli-consumer-goods-dataset/tree/main)

2. You then saw this [ISSUE](https://github.com/TechForPalestine/boycott-israeli-consumer-goods-dataset/issues/8)

- Now this is what you have to do

# Problem

Issue is stated as such

raw data in json format from a pastebin link: https://github.com/TechForPalestine/boycott-israeli-consumer-goods-dataset/blob/main/raw/boycott_list_formatted.json

write a script that parses the data and imports into:

data/brands/ using the brand_schema
data/companies/ using the company_schema
create follow up issue(s) to go through the data and fill in missing fields where required.. preferably include list of files that need updating

## Your understanding

1. The raw file doesnt indicate what is a brand and what is a company 
   1. File itself is 12,000 lines
      1. This is the challenge 
2. Writing the python script is not the issue 
   1. Parsing the file to distinguish between brand and company is the main challenge 
   2. 
> [!WARNING]
> It will take forever to actually read and understand the data. Instead you have to use some ML to understand it 

## How to fuck ?
